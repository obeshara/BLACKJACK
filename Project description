This project involves coding the infamous game of Black Jack which will implement a GUI with certain AI attributes
as one of the options of the game will be to play against the computer. 
Moreover, the game will have two choices for each player, it is to either “hit” or “stand”. 
Each turn, the game will generate a randomly suffled set of cards and any play that generates a value of cards above 21 causes
that player to lose the game. 
It will involve multiple libraries such as Python’s random library to produce a random set of cards, 
pygame which aids in programming video games specifically, 
perhaps the sys library, 
as well as the os library. 
All of that together will be implemented with a GUI that tells the user if they won or lost. 
It displays a Green themed background to the user with a set of cards on opposite sides - randomly shuffled of course. 
By November 25, I hope to finish the logic of the game such as the random shuffle function, 
defining when a player wins or loses, implementing the different symbols (e.g. diamonds) and numbers of the cards.
As for the final features, I hope to finish the GUI aspect of the game by DEC 6, and I may end up adding some sound effects
for the shuffling of the cards.
